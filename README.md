# Job Search Project
This was a Team project to provide current job postings to the seeker along with the current weather in the city of interest.  NOTE:  At the time this project was built, New York City and San Francisco were the only cities that returned job openings (using the GitHub API).  

## What the Project does
* This is a mobile responsive front-end application that provides the job-seeker job opportunities and current weather in the city of interest.
* The data is retrieved via two APIs:
    * The first is to GitHub for job postings ("https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?description=").
    * The second is to the wunderground for current weather ("https://api.wunderground.com/api/".

## Design & Technology
* The design is will meet these requirements:
    * Must uses at least two APIs
    * Must use AJAX to pull data  (AJAX method to put data)
    * Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we haven’t discussed
    * Must have a polished frontend / UI
    * Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
    * Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals!)
    * Must have some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc)  <tbody> repeating elements
    * Must use Bootstrap or Alternative CSS Framework
    * Must be Deployed (GitHub Pages or Firebase)  (hosting on Firebase links to data easier)
    * Must have User Input Validation
* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * Bootstrap -- Responsive web design framework
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Materialize -- Responsive CSS framework
    * JavaScript
    * jQuery library
    * AJAX -- make the API requests
    * Firebase

## Challenges
* Putting all the front-end technologies together took time in research and practice on how to use them correctly.
* Working on a team can be challanging.  Each member brings a different perspective to the table and contributes in different ways.
